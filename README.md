This is a fork of [Syn-McJ]'s [TFClassify-Unity-Barracuda] project. My goal was
to run the Tiny-YOLO model without significant CPU-side overhead. This is not
the best example of the Unity Barracuda inference engine because I removed some
essential components and didn't refactor enough. Still, it might be a good
benchmark of the engine.
